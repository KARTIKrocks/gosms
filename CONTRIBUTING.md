# Contributing to gosms

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/<username>/gosms.git`
3. Create a branch: `git checkout -b my-feature`
4. Make your changes
5. Run checks: `make ci`
6. Push and open a pull request

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24+
- golangci-lint v2

### Running Tests

```bash
make test        # run tests
make test-race   # run tests with race detector
make bench       # run benchmarks
make lint        # run linter
make ci          # run all checks (tidy, fmt, vet, lint, test-race)
```

### Code Style

- Follow standard Go conventions
- Run `gofmt` and `goimports` before committing
- All exported types and functions must have doc comments
- Keep test coverage high for new code

## Pull Requests

- Keep PRs focused on a single change
- Include tests for new functionality
- Update documentation if the public API changes
- Ensure `make ci` passes before requesting review

## Module layout and `go.work`

Each provider (`twilio/`, `sns/`, `vonage/`, `msg91/`) is its own Go module, so
importing `gosms` never drags in every SMS SDK. Each one `require`s a published
version of the root module.

The committed `go.work` at the repo root overrides that requirement with the
working tree. Without it the providers would compile against the *published*
root even here, and a breaking change to the core would pass CI while silently
breaking every provider. No published `go.mod` in this repo carries a `replace`
directive — `go.work` is the only place local resolution is configured, and it
is ignored entirely when someone depends on these modules. (The `examples/`
modules do use `replace`; they are never published, and they stay out of the
workspace so each one remains a self-contained, copy-pasteable program.)

To reproduce a consumer's build, set `GOWORK=off`.

## Releasing

Tag the root module first, then point each provider at that tag. Everything here
is safe to commit to `main` — `go.work` keeps local builds on the working tree
no matter which root version the providers require.

```bash
git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z    # root module first

for mod in twilio sns vonage msg91; do
  (cd "$mod" && go mod edit -require github.com/KARTIKrocks/gosms@vX.Y.Z)
done
make tidy && make test

GOWORK=off make test    # what a consumer actually compiles

git commit -am 'Pin sub-modules to vX.Y.Z'
for mod in twilio sns vonage msg91; do git tag "$mod/vX.Y.Z"; done
git push origin main --tags
```

The sub-module bump has to be its own commit: a module tag resolves to a commit,
and the proxy reads *that commit's* `go.mod`. Tagging before the bump would
publish a provider still requiring the old root.
